		<h2>Academics</h2>
		<p>In terms of my academics at the University of Rochester, I have found my study places to be among that which I consider most important to my academic success. I tend to prefer mostly quiet, cozy places to study. In general, I find a loud and crowded space to be too distracting when trying to accomplish work. My favorite study space on campus is Rettner because of the natural lighting, bright colors, and generally quiet atmosphere. It is also very close to much of campus, which is a big bonus.</p>
		
	

		<h2>Employment</h2>
		<p>My first official paid job was as a camp counselor and photographer at the Chatham Hall summer camps (held at my high school). I had various volunteer jobs before then, including as a film camp counselor, another camp counselor, a production assistant, and more. This past summer I worked as a paid counselor at Indiana University’s Digital Cinema Academy camp teaching high school students about film and videography.</p>
		
	

		<h2>More about me!</h2>
		<p>The next logical step in my journey is figuring out my post-grad plans. While I still have lots to figure out, and lots of time to do it, I have been thinking recently about what exactly I would like to do and where I would like to be. I know for a fact that I want to live and work somewhere with winters that are noticeably warmer than those in Rochester. I am interested in film, media, web design, public relations, and marketing, which are skills that I think can be combined easily. I would love to work in media marketing and helping companies grow their brand.</p>
