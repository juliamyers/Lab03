1. Ontology: The things that are important include the headers which contain the names of each student, the navigation element, and the general information presented on them in paragraph form- their education, employment, and other. 

2. Taxonomy: The name of the student is presented larger at the top to ensure that the user knows the main subject of the information below. Each of the paragraphs are presented with a consistant headers outlining their topic. The navigation is similarly presented in a navigation tag with clear indicators of the current page and other pages a user can navigate to. Students are listed in alphabetical order. 

3. Choreography: The top most thing presented was the individual's name, to ensure that it was clear who the webpage was about. Following this, was an image of the individual, to give to user a visual representation of who they are reading about. Then, we inlcuded education paragraph first, followed by jobs, followed by additional information. Education was perceived to be more important than past employment and was thus placed above it.  Everything is listed directly down, to make it easy for a user to navigate and make their way through the site.
